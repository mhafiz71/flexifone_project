# Plan Completion & Phone Selection Implementation

## âœ… **Issues Resolved**

### ðŸ”§ **Problem 1: Select Plan Button Not Working**
**Issue**: The "Select Plan" button on phone cards linked to `accounts:select_phone` but the view redirected users with existing accounts back to dashboard.

**Solution**: 
- Created new URL pattern `accounts:choose_plan` 
- Updated phone list template to use the new URL
- Modified select_phone_view logic to handle completed plans

### ðŸ”§ **Problem 2: Completed Plan Management**
**Issue**: Users who completed plans couldn't select new phones because the system treated them as having "active" accounts.

**Solution**:
- Added `is_active_plan` logic to distinguish between active and completed plans
- Updated dashboard view to handle completed vs active plans
- Modified account creation logic to reuse existing accounts for new plans

## ðŸš€ **Implementation Details**

### **1. Updated Dashboard Logic (`accounts/views.py`)**
```python
def dashboard_view(request):
    try:
        credit_account = request.user.credit_account
        transactions = credit_account.transactions.all().order_by('-timestamp')
        
        # Check if the account is actually active (not completed/picked up)
        is_active_plan = credit_account.is_active_plan if hasattr(credit_account, 'is_active_plan') else credit_account.status in ['PENDING', 'ACTIVE']
        
    except CreditAccount.DoesNotExist:
        credit_account = None
        transactions = []
        is_active_plan = False

    # Show phones if user has no account OR if their plan is completed
    phones = Phone.objects.filter(is_active=True, stock__gt=0) if not credit_account or not is_active_plan else []
```

### **2. Enhanced Select Phone Logic (`accounts/views.py`)**
```python
@login_required
def select_phone_view(request, phone_id):
    phone = get_object_or_404(Phone, id=phone_id)
    
    # Check if user has an existing account
    if hasattr(request.user, 'credit_account'):
        existing_account = request.user.credit_account
        
        # If user has an active plan (not completed), redirect to dashboard
        is_active_plan = existing_account.is_active_plan if hasattr(existing_account, 'is_active_plan') else existing_account.status in ['PENDING', 'ACTIVE']
        
        if is_active_plan:
            messages.error(request, "You already have an active plan. Complete your current plan before selecting a new phone.")
            return redirect('accounts:dashboard')
        
        # If plan is completed, allow new plan selection
        messages.info(request, f"Starting a new plan for {phone.name}. Your previous plan history is preserved.")
```

### **3. Smart Account Management**
```python
# Handle account creation or update
if hasattr(request.user, 'credit_account'):
    # Update existing account for new plan
    account = request.user.credit_account
    account.phone = phone
    account.account_type = account_type
    account.status = CreditAccount.Status.PENDING
    account.balance = 0.00
    account.accepted_terms = False
    account.accepted_at = None
    account.loan_amount = None
    account.installment_amount = None
    account.next_payment_due_date = None
    account.last_payment_date = None
    account.is_active_plan = True  # Mark as active plan
    account.save()
else:
    # Create new account for first-time users
    account = CreditAccount.objects.create(
        user=request.user,
        phone=phone,
        account_type=account_type,
        is_active_plan=True
    )
```

### **4. Updated URL Patterns (`accounts/urls.py`)**
```python
path('select-phone/<int:phone_id>/', select_phone_view, name='select_phone'),
path('choose-plan/<int:phone_id>/', select_phone_view, name='choose_plan'),
```

### **5. Fixed Phone List Template (`templates/phones/phone_list.html`)**
```html
{% if user.is_authenticated and phone.stock > 0 %}
    <a href="{% url 'accounts:choose_plan' phone.id %}"
        class="w-full bg-gradient-to-r from-green-600 to-green-700 hover:from-green-700 hover:to-green-800 text-white py-3 px-4 rounded-xl font-semibold text-center transition-all duration-200 shadow-lg transform hover:-translate-y-0.5">
        <i class="fas fa-shopping-cart mr-2"></i>
        Select Plan
    </a>
```

### **6. Enhanced Dashboard Template (`templates/dashboard.html`)**
```html
{% if credit_account and is_active_plan %}
    {% if credit_account.status|is_completed_status %}
        {% include '_dashboard_completed.html' %}
    {% elif credit_account.account_type == 'CREDIT' %}
        {% include '_dashboard_bnpl.html' %}
    {% else %}
        {% include '_dashboard_savings.html' %}
    {% endif %}
{% else %}
    {% include '_dashboard_no_plan.html' %}
{% endif %}
```

### **7. Smart Quick Actions**
```html
{% if not credit_account or not is_active_plan %}
    <a href="{% url 'phones:phone_list' %}"
        class="w-full bg-gradient-to-r from-green-600 to-green-700 text-white py-4 px-6 rounded-xl font-semibold hover:from-green-700 hover:to-green-800 transition-all duration-200 flex items-center justify-center shadow-lg">
        <i class="fas fa-mobile-alt mr-2"></i>
        {% if credit_account %}Choose Your Next Phone{% else %}Choose a Phone Plan{% endif %}
    </a>
{% endif %}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **User Flow Now Works As Expected**

### **For New Users:**
1. Visit phone list â†’ Click "Select Plan" â†’ Choose plan type â†’ Accept terms â†’ Start payments

### **For Users with Active Plans:**
1. Visit phone list â†’ Click "Select Plan" â†’ Redirected to dashboard with message about completing current plan

### **For Users with Completed Plans:**
1. Visit phone list â†’ Click "Select Plan" â†’ Start new plan (previous plan history preserved)
2. Dashboard shows "Choose Your Next Phone" button
3. Completed plan dashboard shows "Choose Your Next Phone" after pickup

## âœ… **Features Implemented**

- **âœ… Working "Select Plan" Button** - Now properly routes to plan selection
- **âœ… Plan Completion Management** - Users can start new plans after completion

2. **Working phone selection buttons** throughout the application
3. **Plan history management** with proper state transitions
